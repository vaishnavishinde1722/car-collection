    <h2>TATA GROUP</h2>
    <p>ith a legacy that spreads over eight decades, Tata Motors <br>
        is one of India’s oldest and most iconic automotive manufacturers,<br>
         which has played a pivotal role in the evolution of the<br>
          Indian automotive industry. And with a brand revamp in<br>
           2016, the carmaker has managed to reclaim its status of<br>
            being one of India’s best-selling car manufacturers.<br>
             Adapting to constantly changing market trends, Tata <br>
             has repeatedly proved its mettle by capitalising and<br>
              dominating, even the EV segment. Despite June being <br>
              a rather dull month in terms of overall dispatches and<br>
               consumer excitement, Tata Motors managed to grab an<br>
                aggregate market share of 12.8 percent, to finish as<br>
                 the third best-selling car brand of the month. <br>
